                <p>Developed an spa mail application, key feature is an end‐to‐end encryption ﴾using hybrid method: aes + pgp﴿
                    for both messages and files. Used REST to communicate with the back‐end. I am responsible just for the interface part

                    <p>Developed a mobile app ﴾Apache cordova﴿ for that mail.</p>
                    <p></p>Developed a sample interface project ﴾again: angular, bootstrap, grunt﴿ to be used as a reference by other

                <p>Was involved in various company projects:
                    <ul>
                    <li>TrackTarget ‐ cpa advertising system: tracks user's activity on client's site ﴾internet shops mostly﴿ and
                    reports if
                    the user had made a "lead" ‐ achieved some goal ﴾number of pages, time on site etc﴿. Is still in use. I was
                    responsible for database ﴾mysql﴿, back‐end ﴾php﴿, interface ﴾"vanilla" js﴿ and the tracking script ﴾also
                    js﴿.</li>
                    <li>dsp.kavanga.ru and Republer ‐ identical projects from my point of view. I was responsible for the interface
                    ﴾js,
                    jQuery, ejs﴿ and the back‐end ﴾node.js﴿, though main logic was implemented in the database.</li>
                    <li>eCommece ‐ quite similar to TT, but the main goal of this app is to display a banner with specific goods to
                    the
                    specific user. Is still in use. Those goods are being collected from the user's activity on client's site
                    and then
                    processed on the server. The result is a banner ﴾of swf or html5 type﴿ to be shown to the user. I was
                    responsible for the whole project: mysql, php and js at the interface ﴾with jQuery and ejs﴿.</li></ul></p>

                <p>I was developing php module for creating reports ﴾i.e. huge complecated tables﴿ in pdf and odt formats. Tis

                    During this development I got close to OO programming in php, creating sql functions ﴾plpgsql﴿,
                    understanding of pdf and
                    odt formats. Another task was to create SolidWorks plugin for our pdm system. It was written in C#.
                    I had an experience in communicating with clients and installing our system in the client's network.</p>
