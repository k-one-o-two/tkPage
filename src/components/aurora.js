      <h3>Why</h3>
      <p>
        It has been a lot of northern lights lately. They are getting more
        frequent and intense and I just can't miss these light shows.
      </p>
      <p>Here I've decided to try to share some tips on how to shoot it.</p>
      <h3>Planning</h3>
      <p>
        Whatever you are going to use to take your pictures, you still need to
        find the correct time and place.
      </p>
      <h4>Time</h4>
      <p>
        This is relatively easy. There are quite a lot of apps that alert you
        about an upcoming aurora activity. It's better though to find
        something location specific.
      </p>
      <p>
        I use 2 main sources, this website:{' '}
        <a href="https://rwc-finland.fmi.fi/index.php/space-weather-in-finland/">
          rwc-finland.fmi.fi
        </a>{' '}
        and this TG channel:{' '}
        <a href="https://t.me/aurora_hunter">Aurora Hunters</a>. The amount of
        info they give might be overwhelming, but it's safe to ignore it and
        just react to the red marks (on the web site).
      </p>
      <h4>Place</h4>
      <p>
        This is a bit more complicated. Ideally, you're looking for a lone
        mountain with a 360 degree view of the sky, which is located in some
        really dark place. So, the Orodruin might be a good choice. But if you
        don't live close enough to Mordor, it might be somewhat challenging.
      </p>
      <p>So, lets first try to find a place dark enough.</p>
      <p>
        Here's the map:{' '}
        <a href="https://www.lightpollutionmap.info">lightpollutionmap</a>.
        I'm not a fan of their color scheme, but the data is extremely useful.
        What we're looking for is a place that is not too bright AND there's
        nothing too bright northward from that place. Obviously, the further
        from civilization you get, the darker it is.
      </p>
      <p>
        But you actually don't need a complete darkness, auroras can be seen
        (I mean, seen by your camera) even with some lights in the foreground:
      </p>
      <NoteImage src="/5/3.jpg"></NoteImage>
      <p>
        Auroras, despite being "northern" lights, are not guaranteed to be
        directly on the north - actually, the more intense they are, the more
        random their position is. It may vary both in direction and distance
        from the horizon - there were several times I've seen it right above
        my head, like that one:
      </p>
      <NoteImage src="/5/2.jpg"></NoteImage>
      <p>
        You are going to need a nice, unobstructed view at least to the north.
        Why "at least?"
      </p>
      <NoteImage src="/5/1.jpg"></NoteImage>
      <p>because this image is shot nearly directly eastward.</p>
      <p>
        If there's a whole city to the north of some nice place you've found,
        the place might be useless.
      </p>
      <p>
        There's a bird-watching tower, that is really high and has a great
        view, but it's right to the south from Espoo (despite it not being a
        "real" city, it is still rather bright).
      </p>
      <NoteImage src="/5/poll.png"></NoteImage>
      <p>
        Unless you have some real mountains (and able to climb them) nearby,
        just getting on top of some hill is not going to help you if the top
        of said hill is covered in trees, or is surrounded by lights, as shown
        above.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, in the mountainless place I live in, I've found 3 ways to get the
        view we need:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Lakes</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Fields</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Bird-watching towers</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        There's a lot of lakes in Finland, but not any will do. First of all,
        it needs to be long enough along the meridian. By "enough" I mean at
        least 1 km long.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, you need to be able to actually stand on it's southern
        shore - you don't want to mount your tripod in some swamp (ok,{' '}
        <i>you</i> might want, but I don't find it so amusing).
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're shooting in the middle of the winter it might be less of a
        problem, since lakes tend to freeze.
      </p>
      <NoteImage src="/5/4.jpg"></NoteImage>
      <p>
        A field might be a good choice as well, though they are typically
        smaller than lakes and have more light pollution from lampposts (see
        the 1st image - taken across the field).
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, bird-watching tower is sometimes a good option. The problem
        is that they are typically not high enough to be above all the trees
        around. Another issue might be it's location - as noted above, one of
        the highest towers has a bad location, though it allows to make some
        nice sunset pics.
      </p>
      <NoteImage src="/5/5.jpg"></NoteImage>
      <p>
        So, once you have found the place and got an alert of the aurora
        activity, you can pack your stuff and go take some pics. But what is
        that you have to pack?
      </p>
      <h3>Gear</h3>
      <p>
        If you're ok with just pointing your phone in the sky and letting it
        try to make it's best - just skip this part, it's boring.
      </p>
      <p>Still here?</p>
      <p>
        I shoot with my DSLR which is a Canon EOS 60D, so I'll be describing
        it, your results may vary.
      </p>
      <h4>Lens</h4>
      <p>
        First of all, you're going to need a rather wide lens - all the aurora
        pics above are shot with my EF-S 10-22mm, mostly dialed all the way to
        10. Sometimes I'd like to have even wider angle, but such a lens will
        be hardly usable for anything else.
      </p>
      <h4>Tripod</h4>
      <p>
        You're going to need one. A tall one will be easier to use, especially
        in the snow. It's better if it is adjustable, since you will need to
        be able to point your camera in different directions.
      </p>
      <h4>Settings</h4>
      <p>
        This, as well, might be different for you, since cameras and lens are
        different, but here's some findings.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Exposure time</b>. Originally, I thought it needs to be as high as
        possible, but it was a mistake. You see, auroras "move" (not like
        clouds, they disappear in one place and appear in some another) and
        they do it fast enough to appear too blurry. Therefore, I've realized
        that 5s time is good enough. Make it longer and you'll get blurry
        colorful mess, make is shorter and you'll miss some stars in the
        background.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>ISO</b>. Should be as low as possible to reduce the noise. For me
        800 works fine.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Timer</b>. Do not forget about this feature: you don't want the
        camera to be moved during the shot, so set a timer (2s is enough) so
        that it will make a shot in 2s after you release the shutter button.
      </p>
      <h3>Editing</h3>
      <p>You didn't think these images are not edited, right?</p>
      <NoteImage src="/5/6.jpeg"></NoteImage>
      <p>
        Here is an unedited version of the 3rd image. Yes, my tripod was
        standing sideways, I know.
      </p>
      <p>
        Apart from making it straight, you might want to increase contrast and
        saturation of greens and purples or make other adjustments. Anyway,
        this requires you to use the RAW format.
      </p>
      <h3>You're ready now</h3>
      <p>Or at least, there's nothing more that I can tell you.</p>
