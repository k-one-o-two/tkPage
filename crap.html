The thing is - I have no idea what it takes for a photo to be good. But I think I know what makes it a crappy one, and here I&#x27;ll try to explain it.</p><h3>The definition of crap</h3><p>Take a look at this image (taken by me, not on flickr for obvious reasons):</p><div style="position:relative;height:400px"><img alt="Image" src="/3/cr1.jpg" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" loading="lazy" style="position:absolute;height:100%;width:100%;left:0;top:0;right:0;bottom:0;object-fit:contain;color:transparent"/></div><p>What is depicted here? Quite a lot of things actually and in order to check an image if it is a crappy one we have to name them all. So, there&#x27;s a seagull sitting on some fence with a ferry terminal in the background. And there is a line of trucks there. And some out-of-focus thing in the bottom-right corner.</p><p>The main question is - is that what had been intended to be depicted? In this case I&#x27;d say that it is quite clearly not. I mean, I know it for sure since it is my picture, but I&#x27;ll try to explain why it should be as clear for everyone else.</p><p>Consider<!-- --> <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/k102/53719245076">this picture</a>, which is, imho, not a crap:</p><div style="position:relative;height:400px"><img alt="Image" src="/3/nc1.jpg" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" loading="lazy" style="position:absolute;height:100%;width:100%;left:0;top:0;right:0;bottom:0;object-fit:contain;color:transparent"/></div><p>I had an intention to take a picture of a seagull on an evening sky. What do we see here? Right, just that.</p><p>One can argue:<!-- --> <i>this method only works for minimalistic pictures, like that stupid bird above</i>. So let&#x27;s take another example.</p><div style="position:relative;height:400px"><img alt="Image" src="/3/cr2.jpg" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" loading="lazy" style="position:absolute;height:100%;width:100%;left:0;top:0;right:0;bottom:0;object-fit:contain;color:transparent"/></div><p>This image I took while cycling to Porvoo with my phone. What I wanted to show here is the river, the bridge with nice reflection of it&#x27;s pillars and some sort of a farmhouse. What do we see here - all of the above plus a part of a metal fence and leafless trees on the right. Let&#x27;s just crop them out and see if the picture would benefit from it:</p><div style="position:relative;height:400px"><img alt="Image" src="/3/nc2.jpg" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" loading="lazy" style="position:absolute;height:100%;width:100%;left:0;top:0;right:0;bottom:0;object-fit:contain;color:transparent"/></div><p>Good, but there still is a partly visible car on the bridge. So, in order to make the picture better we&#x27;d better crop it as well. I think you got the idea.</p><p><i>So, you&#x27;re just making an image minimalistic, right?</i></p><p>Well, yes, but actually no.</p><p>Sometimes it&#x27;s not objects that I want to depict. Take a look at this (unedited) image:</p><div style="position:relative;height:400px"><img alt="Image" src="/3/cr3.jpg" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" loading="lazy" style="position:absolute;height:100%;width:100%;left:0;top:0;right:0;bottom:0;object-fit:contain;color:transparent"/></div><p>What do we see here: a van and some pieces of machinery that I can&#x27;t even name. But the reason I&#x27;ve decided to take this picture is the amount of horizontal lines here: from the dashed line on top to the contrast between the big white thing (which is a ferry, but it doesn&#x27;t even matter right now) with the way the blue thing aligned almost perfectly parallel to them. Let&#x27;s try to bring more focus to these lines. To do this, I&#x27;ve<!-- --> <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/k102/53719582599/">made the picture</a> <!-- -->b&amp;w while increasing it&#x27;s contrast.</p><div style="position:relative;height:400px"><img alt="Image" src="/3/nc3.jpg" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" loading="lazy" style="position:absolute;height:100%;width:100%;left:0;top:0;right:0;bottom:0;object-fit:contain;color:transparent"/></div><p>So, the amount of details is now even higher (for example, the mobile fence next to the van is now more visible). Now, my intentions are more aligned with the end result, making a picture (I hope) less crappy.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Ask yourself: &quot;what do I see on the picture?&quot; and try to answer as honest as possible. If the list of things in the answer is significantly longer than you&#x27;d think it should be - the picture is most likely a crap.</p></div></div></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/crap","query":{},"buildId":"BfmPRwEsm-md-QE933-G3","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
